# ToDo List
## A ToDo list with a column for things to do and a column for done. The input box can use the add button or the keyboard's ENTER to add new items to the To Do column. After each entry, the input box is ready for another entry using focus(). This was not built to be responsive for all screen sizes. 
### This  was built from a tutorial [YouTube](https://youtu.be/dHtyDron5ik)
